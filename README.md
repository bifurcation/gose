Gose - A JOSE library in Go
===========================

This package is a pretty minimal implementation of JWK and JWS in Go.  Right now, it supports JWS signing and verification (with all asymmetric algorithms), and marshaling/unmarshaling of JWK and JWS objects.

See `jose_test.go` for examples.
